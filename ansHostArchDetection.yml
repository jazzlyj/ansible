# To get the architecture of the system at the command line:
# ansible HOST -m setup -a 'filter=ansible_architecture'

# For an x86 architecture host, this would return:

# HOST | SUCCESS => {
#     "ansible_facts": {
#         "ansible_architecture": "x86_64"
#     }, 
#     "changed": false
# }

# Hereâ€™s a sample playbook that will print out the architecture of all hosts in your inventory:

- name: print out hosts architectures
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: True
  tasks:
  - debug: var= ansible_architecture

# To run tasks based off the architecture use a when clause:

- name: task to run for x86 architecture
  shell: echo "x86 arch found here"
  when: ansible_architecture == "x86_64"
